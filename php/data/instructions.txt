The Script Script
Phase 1

A friend of yours is an aspiring actor, and like most Starbucks baristas actors, he doesn't exactly have a lot of money to spend on printing out long scripts. Instead, he'd rather just print only his lines from the play. Since you're now a rockstar developer, he came to you for help. Write a script to help him edit his scripts. You're program should take in the name of his character, open the script text, and output only the lines for his character.

Phase 2

Opening night was a disaster! Your friend, the starving "artiste" knew his lines beautifully; every word perfectly memorized. Turns out though, just knowing your lines isn't terribly useful if you don't know when to say them. Without his cues, your friend stood on stage primed and ready to go until the other actors would stare at him awkwardly hinting that it's his turn to speak. For this next version, in addition to your friend's lines output the lines for the character immediately preceding him so he knows when it's his turn to speak.

Phase 3

It's three days later and things have gotten better, but your friend is still having difficulties. When he was out on stage things went swimmingly but back stage was...tense. With no idea when or where your friend should be at any given time, he stood primed at the stage entrance, waiting to run out in front of the audience as soon as he heard another actor give his cue, but also blocking the way for all the others entering and exiting. Things finally fell apart when the audience heard the stage manager calling your friend a buffoon. "Stage directions! Stage directions will solve everything!" your friend exclaims at you. Modify your script to add your friend's entrance and exits, as well as the act and scene numbers so your friend can know what scenes he is and isn't in so he can relax backstage and stay out of the stage manager's way.
